# **Machine Learning Algorithms**
 This repository contains machine learning algorithms that I have coded as a part of the ML course in BITS Goa

## **Results of Algorithms**
### **1. Decision Trees**
The following code builds a decision tree from scratch to classify the data below. The best split is decided by the gain in information after the split. A drop in entropy results in information gain. The algorithm tries to spit the data into pure halves at every split
